<h1>
Fuzzy engine for Java</h1></center>

<blockquote>This fuzzy engine is designed to perform fuzzy evaluations
in Java programs. It is not a fuzzy system shell but rather a set of classes
and methods allowing evaluation of fuzzy rules given in the symbolic form.
Current implementation of the fuzzy engine allows tight integration of
the fuzzy reasoning into Java software, where all evaluations are performed
by the fuzzy engine, while manipulation of the control flow and input-output
operations are performed in Java. Such a structure allows significantly
higher performance than a shell concept. The engine supports evaluation
of fuzzy rules in the symbolic form; fuzzy and/or/not operations; arbitrary
nesting of fuzzy expressions in the left part of a rule; multiple assignment
operations in the right part of a rule; predefined and user-defined hedges;
unconditional assignment operations; dynamically weighted rules; evaluation
of single rules or rule blocks.</blockquote>

<h1>
Linguistic Variables and Membership Functions</h1></center>

<blockquote>Linguistic variables represent a part that closely interacts
both to Java code and fuzzy rules. The same linguistic variable can participate
in fuzzy evaluations performed by different fuzzy engines. Each fuzzy assignment
will be accounted for during defuzzification. Each linguistic variable
has an arbitrary number of associated membership functions: each membership
function is represented by a trapezoid. Trapezoidal membership functions
allow simple implementation of the most widely used forms: rectangle, triangle
and trapezoid.
<p>Creating a linguistic variable takes two steps:
<blockquote>1. Allocation of a linguistic variable
<br><b>Example: </b><tt>LinguisticVariable angle = new LinguisticVariable("angle");</tt>
<br>The String argument will be used to address this particular linguistic
variable in the rules (if angle is ...).
<p>2. Definition of membership functions
<br><b>Example: </b><tt>angle.add("negative", -3.14, -3.14, 0.0314, 0);</tt></blockquote>
"negative" here is the name which will be used to address this membership
function (if angle is negative ...), other four parameters define four
key points of a trapezoid. They follow in the order of left bottom, left
top, right top and right bottom points.</blockquote>

<h1>
Hedges</h1></center>

<blockquote>Hedges allow to express different degrees of membership in
a fuzzy set. The package has three predefined hedges:
<blockquote>"not" -<img SRC="image002.gif" height=24 width=83>
<br>"very" -<img SRC="image004.gif" height=27 width=72>
<br>"somewhat" -<img SRC="image006.gif" height=27 width=100></blockquote>
Arbitrary hedges can be defined by deriving classes from the base class
Hedge. Method getName() should return a string containing the hedge name.
Method hedgeIt() should perform the desired hedge operation.</blockquote>

<h2>
Fuzzy Rules</h2></center>

<blockquote>All fuzzy evaluations are based on the rules in the symbolic
representation. Linguistic variables, membership functions, hedges and
fuzzy operations are referenced by their respective symbolic names. Symbolic
representation of the rules allows easy understanding of the rules and
simplifies the debugging process. Fuzzy rules are represented by text strings
in the following format:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;label> if LV1 is &lt;hedge ...> MF1 &lt;and/or LV2
is &lt;hedge ...> MF2 and/or ...> then LVN is &lt;hedge ...> MFN ... &lt;
and rule label weight is &lt;hedge ...> weightMF></tt>
<p><tt>&lt;label> set LV1 is &lt;hedge ...> MF1 &lt;and LV2 is &lt;hedge
...> MF2 ...> &lt;and rule label weight is &lt;hedge ...> weightMF></tt></blockquote>
<b>"label"</b> - a text label assigned to a rule. A rule's weight (default
is 1.0) is changed by executing expression <tt>"rule label weight is weightMF"</tt>
in the right part of a rule. The same label can be assigned to more than
one rule. In this case weight change will affect all of the labeled rules.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <u>start:</u> if angle is ...</blockquote>
<b>"if"</b> - a service word indicating the beginning of the left part
(evaluation part) of a fuzzy rule.
<p><b>"LV"</b> - a linguistic variable. Linguistic variables are addressed
by their names. Each linguistic variable has one or more associated membership
functions.
<p><b>"is"</b> - a service word separating linguistic variable and hedges/membership
function.
<p><b>"hedge"</b> - the engine has 3 predefined hedges: "not", "very" and
"somewhat". The user can define arbitrary hedges and use them in rules.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> if weather is <b><u>not</u></b> <b><u>very</u></b>
nice ...</blockquote>
<b>"MF"</b> - a membership function. Membership functions are addressed
by their names. Each membership function is defined as a trapezoid.
<p><b>"and/or"</b> - service words indicating logical operation to be performed
on the neighboring fuzzy expressions. Priority of the and/or operations
decreases from left to right and may be changed by applying parenthesis.
The engine supports arbitrary number of expressions on the left part, arbitrary
nesting and and/or operations.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>if angle is wide or (angle is normal and
(speed is high or speed is normal)) ...</tt></blockquote>
<b>"then"</b> - a service word separating left part of expression from
the right part (execution part). Result obtained from evaluation of the
left part is used to perform fuzzy assignments in the right part. The form
of fuzzy expressions is the same as in the evaluation part, except assignment
is performed instead of evaluation. During the assignment, hedges apply
to the result of evaluation part. Application of the hedges is local for
each fuzzy expression. If more than one assignment is to be performed,
then fuzzy expression should separated by the service word <b>"and"</b>
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>...then power is very low and steering
is toTheLeft</tt></blockquote>
<b>"rule"</b> - a service word indication that a rule's weight will be
changed in this expression. This word is followed by a label for the rule
whose weight is about to be changed.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>... then rule start: weight is low ...</tt></blockquote>
<b>"weight"</b> - this is a reserved linguistic variable. Linguistic variable
<b>"weight"</b>
is defined by the user and serves for the purpose of changing a rule's
weight. A copy of this LV is created for each unique label. Changes of
weight are performed by defuzzification of the copy assigned to a particular
label, thus multiple weight changes are carried out in fuzzy manner. How
much a rule's weight will be changed depends both on definition of membership
functions for <b>"weight"</b>, evaluation result after application of hedges
and number of assignments.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>LinguisticVariable weight=new LinguisticVariable("weight");</tt>
<br><tt>weight.add("low",0,0,0.2,0.3);</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.evaluateRule("start: if angle is wide then rule start:
weight is low");</tt></blockquote>
&nbsp;When weight assignment is performed on the same rule that assigns
the weight (see Example) then only one iteration of weight change is performed,
i.e. it does not fall into an endless loop of weight change.
<p><b>"set"</b> - a service word for unconditional assignments. If <b>"set"</b>
is encountered instead of <b>"if"</b>, result of the left part evaluation
is assumed to be 1.0 and all assignments are performed for that value.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>set power is low ...</tt></blockquote>

<h1>
The Fuzzy engine</h1></center>

<blockquote>All fuzzy evaluations are performed by a fuzzy engine. This
Java class allows parsing and evaluation of fuzzy rules. The following
example illustrates the main steps necessary for performing a fuzzy evaluation:
<blockquote>1. Create Lingustic variables and define membership functions
<br><tt>LinguisticVariable angle = new LinguisticVariable(?angle?);</tt>
<br><tt>angle.add(?negative?,-3.14,-3.14,0,0);</tt>
<br><tt>angle.add(?positive?,0,0,3.14,3.14);</tt>
<br><tt>LinguisticVariable power = new LinguisticVariable(?power?);</tt>
<br><tt>power.add(?decreased?,-2,-1,-1,0);</tt>
<br><tt>power.add(?increased?,0,1,1,2);</tt>
<p>2. Create a fuzzy engine
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine = new FuzzyEngine();</tt>
<p>3. Register all LVs
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.register(angle);</tt>
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.register(power);</tt>
<p>4. Peform fuzzy evaluations
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.evaluateRule("if angle is negative then power is increased");</tt>
<p>5. Obtain the result(s)
<br><tt>double result = power.defuzzify();</tt></blockquote>
A fuzzy engine can only parse and evaluate the rules that have been registered
with the engine. A linguistic variable can be registered with more than
one engine.</blockquote>

<center>
<h1>
Blocks of rules</h1></center>

<blockquote>The engine's function evaluateRule() performs parsing the string
argument each time it is called. This leads to the waste of computing time
and slows down the evaluation process. Class FuzzyBlockOfRules allows to
increase execution speed by an order of magnitude by storing pre-parsed
and optimized rules. The usage of BlockOfFuzzyRules is effective when a
group of rules is evaluated over and over. The steps to use a block or
rules:
<blockquote>1. Create Lingustic variables and define membership functions
<br><tt>LinguisticVariable angle = new LinguisticVariable("angle");</tt>
<br><tt>angle.add("negative",-3.14,-3.14,0,0);</tt>
<br><tt>angle.add("positive",0,0,3.14,3.14);</tt>
<br><tt>LinguisticVariable power = new LinguisticVariable("power");</tt>
<br><tt>power.add("decreased",-2,-1,-1,0);</tt>
<br><tt>power.add("increased",0,1,1,2);</tt>
<p>2. Create a fuzzy engine
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine = new FuzzyEngine();</tt>
<p>3. Register all LVs
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.register(angle);</tt>
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.register(power);</tt>
<p>4. Create a block of rules
<br><tt>fuzzyBlockOfRules = new FuzzyBlockOfRules("if angle is negative
then power is increased");</tt>
<p>5. Register the block
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.register(fuzzyBlockOfRules);</tt>
<p>6. Parse the rules
<br><tt>fuzzyBlockOfRules.parseBlock();</tt>
<p>7. Perform the evaluation
<br><tt>fuzzyBlockOfRules.evaluateBlock();</tt> - faster execution
<br><tt>fuzzyBlockOfRules.evaluateBlockText();</tt> - slower execution,
returns a String with evaluation results for every fuzzy expression
<p>8. Obtain the result(s)
<br><tt>double result = power.defuzzify();</tt>
